## Hi there 👋
Here's Davide, the real name behind my nickname.

My learning path and job career brought me here, 
hoping to get some experience, share some projects, and be able to contribute to the community.

Right now, as a beginner programmer, I completed 1 of 2 years Web Development course degree.\
Currently, I'm focused on the following programming languages:\
**- Java**  --> Aiming to get the 1Z0-811 certification\
**- Python** --> Aiming to get the PCEP and PCAP later on.\ 

In my background I have a 2 years professional course in IT administration, since I used to work as IT Helpdesk for 5 years.\
Then a 3 years experience as Service Delivery Manager.

So on my background there's a bit of experience and knowledge in regard of:\
**- Networking**\
**- Server Administration**\
**- Basic SQL**\
**- Basic scripting (Bash, Powershell)**\
**- Pretty good with ticketing tools**\

Hope you'll enjoy\
Take care 🏝
